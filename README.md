# CIND-820-Big-Data-Analytics-Project
The objective is to build a predictive model that accurately classifies risk and also evaluate the risks presented by new business in order to determine acceptance or decline of the new business.

The dataset used is https://www.kaggle.com/c/prudential-life-insurance-assessment/overview which is a public dataset available in Kaggle. Prudential Life Insurance announced a competition in Kaggle in 2016 that invited data scientists to come up with a risk assessment model. The data set consists Train and Test data which describe the characteristics of life insurance applicants. It comprises of nominal, continuous and discrete variables, which are anonymized. It consists of Train data with 59381 clients and test data with 19765 clients and 127 features each. We have to predict the Response variable which ranges from 1 to 8. 8 indicates the highest risk level.

# Proposed research
Neural Network, Decision Trees and Naïve Bayes are proposed to be used in this research. A decision tree model is considered to be nonparametric which does not require assumptions. They do not require the input of any probability distributions about the response. It is an effective algorithm that can handle missing data and it can detect non-linear effects and possible interactions among the explanatory variables. Naïve Bayes is one of the quickest algorithms used for classification purposes and a good one for handling large volumes of data. In this research it can make probabilistic predictions and can handle both continuous and discrete data.
This research will investigate the effectiveness of three algorithms in predicting risk in the insurance dataset. We will evaluate the performance of the algorithms based on accuracy, precision, recall and F1-Score since these metrics are great in evaluating classifications from imbalanced datasets. Therefore, this research aims to identify key trends among different types of supervised machine learning algorithms and in addition, the advantages and limitations of different supervised machine learning algorithms are summarised.

# Model Accuracy

Splitted the dataset into 80% training set and 20% testing set. From running Decision tree model & Naive Bayes model using feature selection, Decision Tree performs the best. It gave an accuracy around 54.31%.
